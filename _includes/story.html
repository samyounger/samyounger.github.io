  <h2>About Sam</h2>
  <h3>Belief</h3>
  <p>
    I was drawn to web development with a belief that with the right drive technically anything could be done.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have began my professional career in the City of London in February 2008 as a Stockbroker at Killik & Co. I transitioned from this after 5 years to Investment Management at Sarasin & Partners where I worked for a little under 4 years.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was increasingly becoming clear to me that the financial services sector is transitioning rapidly to becoming more technically reliant. At this stage I was enjoying getting more stuck into learning Excel VBA and becoming more excited at the prospect of immense efficiency & productivity gains that development allows. It became clear to me that Excel has restrictions such as styling, and can be very temperamental, and so I researched alternative methods of development, of which Web Development appealed. I therefore began down a path to becoming a web developer in early 2015.
  </p>
  <h3>Code beginnings</h3>
  <p>
    I began learning to code in early 2015. From what began as years of learning and using Microsoft Excel, I realised I had accelerated past my peers in Excel capability, and the more I learnt the more I wanted to know about development. Web Developent was widely recommended on sites such as Quora and Stackoverflow as a great starting point to learn development. I came across a free online resource to start the learning on CodeCademy. I clearly remember the first evening I started to write HTML. I started at 18:00, and it was 1:00 in the morning before I realised it was well past my bed time. The thrill I got when my first text appeared in the web browser was great. Thus began my path to where I am today as a web developer.
  </p>
  <h3>General Assembly</h3>
  <p>
    I am not one to make rash decisions. It's all very well enjoying CodeCademy and playing around with direct instructions. I wanted to see just how far I had progressed, whether I had a knack for it, and if I would continue to enjoy coding in higher pressured circumstance. I signed up to the General Assembly Front End Web Development part-time course which takes place over 3 months. There I learnt more about how the internet works, and spent a lot of time learning and improving my HMTL, CSS/SASS, CSS frameworks, and has a small amount of dabbling in JavaScript/jQuery, and WordPress.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was so upset when the GA course above finished, that I knew I had to pursue the coding path I was on. I knew how to make a basic front-end static website, but I was hungry to know more and be able to set up a full-stack website with all the functionality I could think of.
    I accelerated my learning in development by attending the General Assembly 3 month Web Development Immersive program in August 2016. It was a fantastic time in my life, I made great friends, produced some websites I'm really proud of, and it significantly improved my understanding of code and my ability to learn new languages and concepts. I now feel ready to take on any new learning challenge.
  </p>
  <h3>Code languages</h3>
  <p>
    I have learnt a multitude of coding languages and technologies, and this list continues to expand in order to keep up with new tech developments. Some of these include: JavaScript, AngularJS, NodeJS, Ruby, Rails, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Jekyll, CSS/SASS.
  </p>
  <h3>My favourite stack</h3>
  <p>
    The MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, NodeJS) is my favourite to build with, however I have also produced a site with a Rails API and Angular on the front which was fun to work with. This project is listed below called BodhiNomad.
  </p>
  <h3>What's next?</h3>
  <p>
    While I have learnt an enormous amount over the last 2 years, I feel like I am at the tip of the iceberg and I'm eager to learn more and be able to do ever increasingly complex applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    My next coding challenge is to learn ReactJS which is fast gaining popularity in the coding community. I will likely also start to learn Angular2. I will be going to meetups in London to learn more, hopefully I will see you there.
