      <h2>About Sam</h2>
      <p>I can see the world changing fast around me. It is clear to me that technology is fast grabbing market share while providing better products to customers at lower costs. I have an enquiring mind, and I’m drawn to exciting developments. I’ve been fascinated by the huge creative drive of the tech industry and the amazing businesses which have emerged. In 2015 I decided I could no longer see such change happening from the side-lines, and so I started on a journey learning to program and networking in the start-up scene.</p>
      <p>I have worked with my hands on a farm, served in a bar/restaurant, sold ideas as a stockbroker, and managed peoples savings as an investment manager (among other things). This has provided me with useful perspective when determining my future. Programing is changing our lives, and I want to help drive that change.
