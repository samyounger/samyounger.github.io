      <h2>About Sam</h2>
      <h3>Belief</h3>
      <p>
        I was drawn to web development with a belief that with the right drive technically anything could be done.
      </p>
      <h3>Code beginnings</h3>
      <p>
        I began learning to code in early 2015. From what began as years of learning and using Microsoft Excel, I realised I had a passion for coding which fast developed into an enthusiasm for web development.
      </p>
      <h3>General Assembly</h3>
      <p>
        I kickstarted my learning in development by attending the General Assembly 3 month Web Development Immersive program. It was a fantastic time in my life, I made great friends, produced some websites I'm proud of, and it significantly accellerated my code understanding and learning.
      </p>
      <h3>Code languages</h3>
      <p>
        I have learnt a multitude of coding languages and technologies, and this list continues to expand in order to keep up with new tech developments.
      </p>
      <h3>My favourite stack</h3>
      <p>
        The MEAN stack is my favourite to build with, however I have also produced a site with a Rails API and Angular on the front which was fun to work with.
      </p>
      <h3>What's next?</h3>
      <p>
        My next coding challenge is to learn ReactJS which is fast gaining popularity in the coding community. Potentially Angular2 will be on the learning list.
      </p>

      <!-- <p>I can see the world changing fast around me. It is clear to me that technology is fast grabbing market share while providing better products to customers at lower costs. I have an enquiring mind, and I’m drawn to exciting developments. I’ve been fascinated by the huge creative drive of the tech industry and the amazing businesses which have emerged. In 2015 I decided I could no longer see such change happening from the side-lines, and so I started on a journey learning to program and networking in the start-up scene.</p>
      <p>I have worked with my hands on a farm, served in a bar/restaurant, sold ideas as a stockbroker, and managed peoples savings as an investment manager (among other things). This has provided me with useful perspective when determining my future. Programming is changing our lives, and I want to help drive that change.
