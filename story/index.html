  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I was drawn to web development with a belief that with the right drive technically anything could be done.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have began my professional career in the City of London in February 2008 as a Stockbroker at <a href="https://www.killik.com/" target="_blank">Killik & Co</a>. I transitioned from this after 5 years to Investment Management at <a href="https://www.sarasinandpartners.com/private-clients" target="_blank">Sarasin & Partners</a> where I worked for a little under 4 years.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was increasingly becoming clear to me that the financial services sector was transitioning rapidly to becoming more technically reliant. At this stage I was enjoying learning Excel VBA and becoming more excited at the prospect of the immense efficiency & productivity gains that development allows. It became clear to me that Excel has restrictions such as styling, can be very temperamental, and is an enclosed development ecosystem, and so I researched alternative methods of development.
  </p>
  <h3>Code beginnings</h3>
  <p>
    I began learning to code in early 2015. Web Developent was widely recommended on sites such as <a href="https://www.quora.com/" target="_blank">Quora</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a> as a great first step to development. I came across a free online resource to start the learning on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">CodeCademy</a>. I still remember the thrill I got when I used HTML for the first time and text appeared in the web browser.
  </p>
  <h3>General Assembly</h3>
  <p>
    I am not one to make rash decisions. It's all very well enjoying CodeCademy and following instructions, but I wanted to see just how far I had progressed, whether I had an aptitude for it, and if I would continue to enjoy coding at a more demanding level. I signed up to the General Assembly <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/front-end-web-development" target="_blank">Front End Web Development</a> part-time course which takes place over 3 months. There I learnt more about how the internet works, and spent a lot of time learning HMTL, CSS/SASS, CSS frameworks, and some dabbling in JavaScript / jQuery, and WordPress.</br>
    The quote below nicely personifies how I felt after the course finished.

      Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.

  </div>

  <p>
    I enjoyed the course and development so much I knew I had to pursue the coding path I was on. I had learnt how to make basic front-end static websites, but I was hungry to know more and be able to set up a full-stack website with all the functionality I could think of.
    I accelerated my learning in development by attending the General Assembly 3 month <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive" target="_blank">Web Development Immersive</a> program in August 2016. It was a fantastic time in my life, I made great friends, produced websites I'm proud of, and it significantly improved my understanding of programming and my ability to learn new languages and technologies. I now felt ready to take on the next challenge and start a career in programming.
  </p>
  <h3>Code languages</h3>
  <p>
    I have learnt a multitude of coding languages and technologies, and this list continues to expand in order to keep up with new tech developments. Some of these include: JavaScript, ReactJS AngularJS, NodeJS, Ruby, Rails, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, CSS/SASS.

  <h3>My favourite stack</h3>
  <p>
    The MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, NodeJS) is my favourite to build with. I enjoy programming with JavaScript and this allows me to use it both on the front and back-end. I have produced websites using full-stack Rails, and with a back-end Rails and front-end AngularJS which was fun to build.
  </p>
  <h3>What's next?</h3>
  <p>
    While I have learnt an enormous amount over the last 2 years, I feel like I am at the tip of the iceberg and I'm eager to learn more and be able to do ever increasingly complex applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have begun to learn ReactJS, specifically React-Native for mobile development. I have found it a bit tricky getting to grips with including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript all in one page with JSX, and learning to make components. However the more I use it, the more I see its immense potential at making programming more efficient. I will likely also start to learn Angular2. I will be going to meetups in London to learn more, hopefully I will see you there.
