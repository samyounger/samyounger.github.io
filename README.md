My personal profile site
=========================

Run the site on your local host: in the console `$ jekyll serve` and it will start up on `localhost:4000`.

This page was produced using Jekyll.

## Background

I had not used Jekyll before this site other than a rudimentary introduction. While Jekyll is not overly complicated, I found the file layout, yaml file, and the layouts & includes take a bit of getting used to. Once mastered however it's very useful.

## Design origin

I started by using the theme by Jerome Lachaud, the original template located [here](https://jeromelachaud.github.io/grayscale-theme) which I liked for its simplicity and clear look.

Jerome's site was built using bootstrap and some basic css. Initially I converted all CSS to SCSS and tidied up the file layout after much research to a setup which I was happy with.
