My personal profile site
=========================

This page was produced using Jekyll.

If you want to run it on your local computer, in your console type 'jekyll s' and it will start up on localhost:4000.

###Background
I had not used Jekyll before this site other than a rudimentary introduction. While Jekyll is not overly complicated, I found the file layout, yaml file, and the layouts & includes take a bit of getting used to. Once mastered however it's very useful.

I started by using the theme by Jerome Lachaud, the original template located [here](https://jeromelachaud.github.io/grayscale-theme) which I liked for its simplicity and clear look.

I started by creating a simpler file setup using jekyll 'includes' and 'layouts', and converting the CSS files to SCSS. I then started building on the site adding additional pages including 'more about me' and the 'blog'. I made big changes to the css/scss file, including splitting out the bootstrap and font-stack to a different sass file imported into the style.scss file, and re-writing large chunks of the css to be tidier and more legible. One of the biggest changes was making the site mobile-responsive, in particular removing any of the images for fast reload times.

As the site expands I am continually tempted to add a back-end so that I could have user profiles to save comments on my blogs. However I want to keep this site as simple as possible, low-cost, and so the longer I can keep it Jekyll only the better. I suspect I will only start to add additional functionality once I have a reasonably large library of blogs. Also, given that this site does not really have a public profile, it is nice to experiment with new things.
