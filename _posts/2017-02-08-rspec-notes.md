    DESCRIPTION: RSpec is a testing GEM for Ruby, supposedly easier to read for non-developers.

Its documentation is located here:

<http://rspec.info/>

To install:
`$ gem install rspec`

This gives you access to `$ rspec` from the terminal.

To initialize in the project:
`$ rspec --init`

To install rspec into the current rails project:
`$ rails g rspec:install`

To add color and formatting to the rspec testing code:
`$ rspec --color --format documentation` and then the file path.

- or in the `.rspec` file put the formatting for color and format.
