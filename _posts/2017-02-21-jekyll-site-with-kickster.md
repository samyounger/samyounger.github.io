    DESCRIPTION: In my pursuit to build a better personal blogging website and learning more about Jekyll, I am going to build a site using Kickster, recommended on Jekyll's Docs "for easy (automated) deploys to GitHub Pages when using unsupported plugins on GitHub Pages."

[Kickster](http://kickster.nielsenramon.com/)

## About

Kickster describes itself as being ideal for fast prototyping so developers can focus on the fun parts.

## Setup

The setup instructions are clear and simple. In the terminal type:

```sh
# Installation
~ $ gem install kickster
~ $ kickster new site_name
~ $ cd site_name
~ $ bin/setup

# Deployment
~ $ bin/deploy # this deploys to github
```
