    DESCRIPTION: After three years of software engineering experience in Ruby, I was planning to move from London to Edinburgh. I did plenty of research, practice, and investigation in preparing for the various interviews. The following is some of my notes, with the code solutions in Ruby. Not the most captivating of reads, but it might be useful to some.

# Interview Practice

These are a set of common questions asked to attain a software engineering position, either for computer science graduates, or programmers with 2-3 years of experience.

#### Practice practice practice

In additional to these questions scoured from various different sites, I practiced working through coding problems using the fantastic [Exercism.io](https://exercism.io).

#### Looking forward ðŸ”­

Finally, as a non computer science graduate (I did a geography degree), I constantly suffer from the fear of not knowing what I don't know. I'm finally looking to resolve this and start to learn more in depth how and why things work the way they do. I'm starting with reading the book [Clean Code](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238) by Robert Martin. Once this is read, the next stop on my learning journey is [The Art of Computer Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming) by Donald Knuth. I am hoping both of these books and any additional study will help me move beyond the boundaries of Ruby to more statically typed languages such as Go, Scala and Java. I have been doing Ruby for long enough now that I know Dynamically typed languages have severe constraints such as performance, and not being type safe. As a curious programmer, I want to solve these problems.

## Arrays

Questions about array manipulation.

### Question 1
How do you find the missing number in a given integer array of 1 to 100?

### Solution
1. Get the sum of numbers which is total = n*(n+1)/2
2. Subtract all the numbers from sum and you will get the missing number

source: [GeekForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-missing-number)

```rb
class MissingIntegerFinder
  def find_missing_integer(numbers)
    count = numbers.size

    total = (count + 1) * (count + 2) / 2

    sum_of_numbers = numbers.sum

    total - sum_of_numbers
  end
end

# Test
numbers = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]

finder = MissingIntegerFinder.new

missing_number = finder.find_missing_integer(numbers)

# => 3
```
---

### Question 2
How do you find the duplicate number on a given integer array?

### Solution
Traverse the array once. While traversing, keep track of count of all elements in the array using a temp array count[] of size n, when you see an element whose count is already set, print it as duplicate.

source: [GeekForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-two-repeating-elements-in-a-given-array)

```rb
class FindRepeatingNumbers
  def find(numbers)
    number_counts = [0] * numbers.length

    repeats = []

    number_counts.each_with_index do |number, index|
      if number_counts[numbers[index]] >= 1
        repeats << numbers[index]
      else
        number_counts[numbers[index]] = number_counts[numbers[index]] + 1
      end
    end

    repeats
  end
end

# Test
numbers = [4, 2, 4, 5, 2, 3, 1]
finder = FindRepeatingNumbers.new
finder.find(numbers)
```

---

### Question 3
How do you find the largest and smallest number in an unsorted integer array?

### Solution

source: [GeekForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kth-smallestlargest-element-unsorted-array)

```rb
class NthSizeFinder
  def find(numbers, index)
    sorted_numbers = numbers.sort
    sorted_numbers[index - 1]
  end
end

numbers = [12, 3, 5, 7, 19] 
finder = NthSizeFinder.new
finder.find(numbers, 4)
# => 12
```

---

### Question 4
How do you find all pairs of an integer array whose sum is equal to a given number?

### Solution
Create a map to store frequency of each number in the array. (Single traversal is required)

In the next traversal, for every element check if it can be combined with any other element (other than itself!) to give the desired sum. Increment the counter accordingly.

After completion of second traversal, weâ€™d have twice the required value stored in counter because every pair is counted two times. Hence divide count by 2 and return.

source: [GeekForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-pairs-with-given-sum)

```rb
require 'set'

def sum_pairs(ints, sum)
  already_seen = Set.new

  ints.each do |int|
    return [sum - int, int] if already_seen.include?(sum - int)
 
    already_seen.add(int)
  end

  nil
end

sum_pairs([10, 5, 2, 3, 7, 5], 10)
# => [3, 7]
sum_pairs([10, 5, 2, 3, 7, 5], 20)
# => nil
```

---

### Question 5
How do you find duplicate numbers in an array if it contains multiple duplicates?

### Solution
By using two loops. It has a time complexity of O(n2).

source: [GeekForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-duplicates-given-array-elements-not-limited-range)

```rb
require 'set'

def find_duplicates(numbers)
  duplicates = Set.new

  numbers.each_with_index do |number, index|
    duplicates.add(number) if numbers.find_index(number) != index
  end

  duplicates.to_a
end

numbers = [2, 10, 100, 2, 10, 11]
find_duplicates(numbers)
# => [2 10]
```

---

## Strings

Questions about string manipulations. Most solutions focus on splitting the string into an array, so a lot of the answers above can be used again here.

### Question 1
How do you print duplicate characters from a string?

### Solution

source: [GeekForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-all-the-duplicates-in-the-input-string)

```rb
def find_duplicate_chars(string)
  characters = string.each_char.to_a

  duplicates = []

  characters.each_with_index do |char, index|
    duplicates << char if characters.find_index(char) != index
  end

  duplicates
end

string = "helloo"
find_duplicate_chars(string)
# => ["l", o"]
```

---

### Question 2
How do you check if two strings are anagrams of each other?

### Solution

source: [GeekForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-whether-two-strings-are-anagram-of-each-other)

```rb
def anagram_check(first_word, second_word)
  one = first_word.each_char.to_a.sort
  two = second_word.each_char.to_a.sort

  one == two
end

first_word = "foobar"
second_word = "foobar"
anagram_check(first_word, second_word)
# => true

first_word = "foobar"
second_word = "blabla"
anagram_check(first_word, second_word)
# => false
```

---

### Question 3
How do you print the first non-repeated character from a string?

### Solution

source: [GeekForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-a-string-find-its-first-non-repeating-character)

```rb
def non_repeat_char_finder(string)
  string.chars.find { |character| string.count(character) == 1 }
end

string = "geekforgeeks"
non_repeat_char_finder(string)
# => "f"
```

---

### Question 4
How can a given string be reversed using recursion?

```rb
def reverse(string, count = 0)
  return string if string.length == 1

  reversed_str = reverse(string[1..-1], count)
  reversed_str += string[0]
  reversed_str
end

string = "foobar"
reverse(string)
```

---

### Question 5
How do you check if a string contains only digits?

```rb
def only_digits(string)
  string.scan(/\D/).empty?
end

string = "foobar"
only_digits(string)
# => true

string = "123"
only_digits(string)
# => false
```

---

### Question 6
How are duplicate characters found in a string?

```rb
def duplicate_character_finder(string)
  string.each_char.select do |char|
    string.count(char) > 1
  end.uniq
end

string = "foobara"
duplicate_character_finder(string)
# => ["o", "a"]
```

---

### Question 7
How do you count a number of vowels and consonants in a given string?

```rb
def count_vowels_and_consonants(string)
  vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]
  vowel_count = string.scan(/[aeiou]/).count

  consonants = ("a".."z").to_a - vowels
  consonant_count = string.scan(/#{consonants}/).count

  { vowels: vowel_count, consonants: consonant_count }
end

string = "foobario"
count_vowels_and_consonants(string)
# => { vowels: 5, consonants: 3 }
```

---

### Question 8
How do you count the occurrence of a given character in a string?

```rb
def character_occurrence_count(string, char)
  string.scan(/#{char}/).count
end

string = "foobario"
character_occurrence_count(string, "o")
# => 3
```

---

### Question 9
How do you find all permutations of a string?

```rb
def permutations(string)
  string.chars.permutation.map(&:join)
end

string = "foobario"
permutations(string)
# => ...
```

---

### Question 10
How do you reverse words in a given sentence without using any library method?

```rb
def sentence_word_reverse(sentence)
  words = sentence.split(" ")
  words.map { |word| word.reverse }.join(" ")
end

sentence = "I am sam"
sentence_word_reverse(sentence)
# => "I ma mas"
```

---

### Question 11
How do you check if two strings are a rotation of each other?

```rb
def rotation_check(string_one, string_two)
  return false if string_one.length != string_two.length

  temp_str = string_one.dup << string_one

  return true if temp_str.include?(string_two)

  false
end

str1 = "ABCD"
str2 = "CDAB"
rotation_check(str1, str2)
# => true

str1 = "ABCD"
str2 = "ACBD"
rotation_check(str1, str2)
# => false
```

---

### Question 12
How do you check if a given string is a palindrome?

```rb
def palindrome_check(string)
  string == string.reverse
end

string = "abba"
palindrome_check(string)
# => true

string = "baba"
palindrome_check(string)
# => false
```
