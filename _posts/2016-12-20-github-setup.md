<div>Set up a GitHub account</div>

* Description: GitHub is an online storage source for developers to save their code and collaborate on group projects
* https://github.com/

Create a new repository for the project

* Top right press the + button, and click 'New repository'
* Enter a name for the project (do not use spaces)
* Give the project a simple description
* Leave the repository as Public, unless you wish to pay for a private one (starts at c. $7/m). Public means anybody can view your projects code and download it
* Click the box to initialize the repository with a README file.
* Click 'Create repository'

Invite me as a collaborator

* In the project repository, click Settings, and then Collaborators from the left-hand menu
* If you type in 'samyounger' I should be the only option that appears.
